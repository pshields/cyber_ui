# Cyber UI

Cyber UI provides Angular components and services for task management, prediction management, decision support, and related topics. `Cyber` (short for cybernetics), as used in this project's title, refers to the capability of humans to augment their abilities using technology.

A demo is available at https://cyberui.org/.

Cyber UI follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and is currently pre-v1. Breaking changes are likely up until the v1 release.

## Acknowledgements

* [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6 was used to generate some of the initial scaffolding, configuration, documentation, and boilerplate code.
* [Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material2) provides many useful UI components that Cyber UI uses and builds on.

## Q & A

### What visual design guidelines does Cyber UI follow?

Cyber UI generally attempts to conform to the [Material Design](https://material.io/) aesthetic and principles.

### How does Cyber UI relate to Angular Material?

Cyber UI uses Angular Material components when it is feasible to do so, in order to keep the Cyber UI code surface smaller and less expensive to maintain.
