// Angular Material style overrides for use in conjunction with the Cyber UI theme service

// This mixin can be applied to an Angular component host in order to address some issues that arise
// from using Angular Material components in conjunction with the Cyber UI theme service. Material
// components which are descendants of the host will receive these patches.
//
// TODO Consider turning into a reusuable class to reduce bundle size instead of mixing in the same
// CSS statements in multiple places
