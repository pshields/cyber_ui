// Angular Material style overrides for use in conjunction with the Cyber UI theme service


// This mixin can be applied to an Angular component host in order to address some issues that arise
// from using Angular Material components in conjunction with the Cyber UI theme service. Material
// components which are descendants of the host will receive these patches.
//
// TODO Consider turning into a reusuable class to reduce bundle size instead of mixing in the same
// CSS statements in multiple places
//
// NOTE: To avoid having these rules applied indiscriminately throughout the entire document, this
// mixin should be applied within a :host { ... } selector block in the Angular component's styles
@mixin angular-material-overrides-for-cyber-ui-theme-service {

  // The ::ng-deep is necessary because the elements these selectors match are usually not in the
  // field components' views, but rather in the interior Angular Material components' views
