// TODO test that getLabelForField calls the field's #format method rather than using the property value directly
// TODO test that for a choice field, the chip filter label is "[Field label]: [Option label]"
// TODO test that multiple filters can be selected at once (multiselect is true on the mat-chips), and that multiple filters can actually show up as active
// TODO  test that selected (active) chips are a different color (the primary color) than the unselected ones
