// TODO test that getLabelForField calls the field's #format method rather than using the property value directly
// TODO test that for a choice field, the chip filter label is "[Field label]: [Option label]"
// TODO test that multiple filters can be selected at once (multiselect is true on the mat-chips), and that multiple filters can actually show up as active
// TODO test that selected (active) chips are a different color (the primary color) than the unselected ones
// TODO test that when the filter is set (aka active), the trailing icon is the 'close' icon, and clicking it clears the filter
// TODO test that when the filter is clear (aka inactive), the trailing icon is 'arrow_drop_down', and clicking it has the same behavior as clicking the rest of the filter chip
