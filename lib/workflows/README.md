# Workflows

## What are the properties of a workflow?

Some preliminary thoughts:

* An Angular component to initialize when the user is visiting that path
* (Optional) URL path (e.g. `/workflows/work-on-tasks`, `/workflows/add-thing`)

## How might a workflow be accessed?

* Directly via URL
* Through a link elsewhere in the app
* Inside of a dialog (e.g. a Material dialog)
