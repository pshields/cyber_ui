# Task templates (IN PROGRESS; VERY EARLY DRAFT)

## Problem statement

Task suggestions are not always 1-to-1 with tasks in an existing task list. Some tasks are best conceived of as instantiations of task templates which may take one or more parameters. In order to suggest such tasks, a task management system should be able to instantiate tasks from templates.
