# Task suggestions

(In progress; early draft)

## Document goals

* Explain the problem that task suggestion solve
* Explain Cyber UI's approach to task suggestions and task suggestion services at a technical level
* Explain some of the common task suggestion use cases and task suggestion services Cyber UI provides to address them

## Introduction

Task suggestions, and task suggestion services, are central concepts to Cyber UI. It is anticipated that most user-facing work will be presented to users via task suggestions of some kind.

## Common task suggestion use cases

The following use cases involving task suggestions are common enough that Cyber UI may support them explicitly in the future.

### Adding completion criteria to existing tasks

One way to make tasks less aversive is to give them concrete completion criteria. By prompting the user to write down a task's completion criteria, we can start to help the user break the task down into more manageable pieces.

### Entering the next sub-task or action for the current project or task

Sometimes the task management system does not know the next concrete task that needs to be performed in furtherence of a higher-level task or project. In such cases, it sometimes can be useful to solicit the next action or task from the user.
