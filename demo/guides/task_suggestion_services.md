# Task suggestion services

(In progress; early draft)

## Document goals

* Explain Cyber UI's approach to task suggestion services at a technical level
* Explain some of the common task suggestion services Cyber UI provides

## Introduction

One of the fundamental workflows anticipated by Cyber UI is that of showing the user a feed of task suggestions. Task suggestion services populate this feed.

## Data flow

The data flow necessary to support a variety of task suggestions and task suggestion services can quickly grow complex. It can be helpful to visualize the data flow as a diagram in order to make it more comprehensible.

### Example data flow diagram

The following diagram describes the data flow in a simple example task suggestion service network.
